## Program Goals
"In this Challenge, youâ€™ll apply your understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, you will examine price changes over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year." 

(copied from BootcampSpot Module 11 Challenge Overview)

## Dependencies
pandas, sklearn libraries

## Setup Instructions
Run pip install pandas and sklearn before running program (if you do not already have these libraries).

Next, run the following:

    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    rom sklearn.decomposition import PCA
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

Then you're ready to roll.

## How to use
Run each jupyter notebook cell. That's pretty much it.

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this project:

95% class notes

5% AI assistance

I was able to stick to the class notes for the vast majority of this project, stopping to ask an AI a couple questions here and there about why I was doing what I was doing.
